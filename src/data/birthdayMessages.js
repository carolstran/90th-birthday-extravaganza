    message: "Just wanted to wish you the happiest of birthdays. Not much is happening around here. We have been able to do a few things despite the co vid thing going. Going to the lake and enjoying the grandkids.  JP is just finishing up 2nd crop hay but most of the land he rents out to other farmers. Only have a few cows just enough for butchering and pay a few bills.  The summer here was pretty hot with lots of rain.  We have a garden that is keeping us busy now. \n\n Hope you had a great birthday and celebration.  Jill did a great job on the website, we especially enjoyed looking at the old pictures of the farm and everyone. I don‚Äôt think our girls ever saw a picture of the farm house. \n\n  If you ever get out to Wisconsin please stop by or come stay at the lake.  Love and God bless on your birthday and give our love to everyone.",

Lo and Behold - no, not the second coming but the email with your address so I could write you. I hope you had a good birthday. Now for sure you can call yourself BIG and OLD. It‚Äôs quite an accomplishment. Lots of years, lots of memories, lots of people who have known you. And quite a life. Congratulations on all the folks you known, the family you have raised, the houses you have chain sawed, er remodeled. Some story.\n\n Take care of yourself, Big.",

(Not to mention watching umpire Joe in action too).  Thanks for all the fun and laughs over the years.

We had some great times on the golf course and on the back deck having beer and brats. We all hope you enjoy your BIG DAY and keep on going strong. However you still owe me a chain for my saw that you borrowed to cut open the side of your house to move the window and the sliding door.And we still talk about the toilet in the closet for your Mom. \n\n Love you Man, Happy Birthday from all the McDonalds",

But I don't think we'll be spending my birthdays at Burger King - I have better taste in 2020!! Love you.",

Someone must have photoshopped that for you! :)  Lots of great memories of Friday night lights with the Owatonna 'Indians', baseball at Dartts Park and Apache camping trailers.  I could always hear Joe cheering above the crowd at Indian football, basketball and baseball games.  Thanks for all the great memories !!!   Hope you have a special  90th  with your family and a lot of Zoom friends.  You still have a graceful golf swing so I know you must be scoring less than 90 on the links. \n\n Happy Birthday. \n\n P.S.Could you give Bruce a few golf lessons to get him ready for the next Stimson Cup? :)",
