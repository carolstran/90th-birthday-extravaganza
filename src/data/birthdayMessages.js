      "We are wishing you the happiest of birthdays ‚ÄúGrandpa Joe‚Äù! \n\n We certainly were blessed to have such fun years with you and Carol during Jake and Josh‚Äôs Camas Little League days.  Those were some of the best years we‚Äôve had visiting you in Arizona for spring training and getting to watch all those baseball games and tournaments.  (Not to mention watching umpire Joe in action too).  Thanks for all the fun and laughs over the years. We have great memories. \n\n Sending love and happy 90th birthday wishes for another great year Joe! God bless! üíï \n\n Love, JoLynn & the rest of the Mansur‚Äôs",

      "Big Guy, \n\n I think it was 40 years ago when you hit your 2 iron farther than I hit my driver at Tumwater Valley. We had some great times on the golf course and on the back deck having beer and brats. We all hope you enjoy your BIG DAY and keep on going strong. However you still owe me a chain for my saw that you borrowed to cut open the side of your house to move the window and the sliding door.And we still talk about the toilet in the closet for your Mom. \n\n Love you Man, Happy Birthday from all the McDonalds",

      "Happy Birthday to my dad - not everyone is lucky enough to have a dad who would: \n\n 1) Drive over 75 miles roundtrip in the winter to buy a Burger King Whopper on my 10th birthday. \n\n 2) Spend so much time with me at the horse barn when I got my horse when I turned 12 years old. \n\n 3) Attend my very first Nascar race this year when I am 62 - which included infield tickets so I could see the cars and drivers up close. \n\n Can't wait to see what adventures come up in the future! But I don't think we'll be spending my birthdays at Burger King - I have better taste in 2020!! Love you.",

      "Hey Joe - Who is that devilishly good looking guy in the high school graduation picture?  Someone must have photoshopped that for you! :)  Lots of great memories of Friday night lights with the Owatonna 'Indians', baseball at Dartts Park and Apache camping trailers.  I could always hear Joe cheering above the crowd at Indian football, basketball and baseball games.  Thanks for all the great memories !!!   Hope you have a special  90th  with your family and a lot of Zoom friends.  You still have a graceful golf swing so I know you must be scoring less than 90 on the links. \n\n Happy Birthday. \n\n P.S.Could you give Bruce a few golf lessons to get him ready for the next Stimson Cup? :)",
